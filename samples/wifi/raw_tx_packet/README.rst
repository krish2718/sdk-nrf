The Raw TX packet sample demonstrates how to transmit raw IEEE 802.11 packets.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Overview
********
The sample generates and broadcasts 802.11 beacon frames as raw TX packets.
As a consequence, the nRF70 Series device can be identified as a Wi-Fi beaconing device.

The sample demonstrates how to transmit raw TX packets in both connected Station and non-connected Station modes of operation.
The sample provides the option to select the traffic pattern between the following modes:

* Continuous packet transmission.
* Fixed number of transmitted packets.

The configurations for connected Station or non-connected Station modes, and for continuous or fixed packet transmission, are set at build time.

Configuration options
=====================

The following sample-specific Kconfig options are used in this sample (located in :file:`samples/wifi/raw_tx_packet/Kconfig`):

.. options-from-kconfig::

* Operating mode

  * Configuration options for connected Station mode
  * Configuration options for non-connected Station mode

* Configuration options for Raw TX packet header

Configuration options for connected Station mode
------------------------------------------------

To configure the sample in connected Station mode, you must configure the following Wi-Fi® credentials in the :file:`prj.conf` file:

* ``Service Set Identifier (SSID)``: Defines the name of your Wi-Fi network.
* ``Key management``: Specifies the key management method, such as WPA2™, WPA3™, or other encryption protocols.
* ``Password``: Sets the Pre-shared Key (PSK) of your Wi-Fi network.

.. note::
   You can also use ``menuconfig`` to enable the ``Key management`` option.

See :ref:`zephyr:menuconfig` in the Zephyr documentation for instructions on how to run ``menuconfig``.

Configuration options for non-connected Station mode
----------------------------------------------------

To configure the sample in non-connected Station mode, you must configure the ``Channel`` parameter in the :file:`prj.conf` file.

This specifies the Wi-Fi channel to be used for communication on the wireless network.

Configuration options for raw TX packet header
----------------------------------------------

The following configuration options are available for the raw TX packet header:

* ``MCS index or Data rate value``: Specifies the data transmission PHY rate.
* ``Rate flags``: Specifies the data transmission mode.
* ``Queue number``: Specifies the transmission queue to which raw TX packets are assigned for sending.

Additionally, you must configure the ``Inter-frame delay`` parameter in the :file:`prj.conf` file to define the time delay between raw TX packets.

This sets the time duration between raw TX packets.

IP addressing
*************

The sample uses DHCP to obtain an IP address for the Wi-Fi interface.
It starts with a default static IP address to handle networks without DHCP servers, or if the DHCP server is not available.
Successful DHCP handshake will override the default static IP configuration.

You can change the following default static configuration in the :file:`prj.conf` file:

.. code-block:: console

  CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_ADDR="192.168.1.98"
  CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
  CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_GW="192.168.1.1"

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/raw_tx_packet`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

The sample can be built for the following configurations:

* Continuous raw 802.11 packet transmission in the connected Station mode.
* Fixed number of raw 802.11 packet transmission in the connected Station mode.
* Continuous raw 802.11 packet transmission in the non-connected Station mode.
* Fixed number of raw 802.11 packet transmission in the non-connected Station mode.

To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`` build target.
The following are examples of the CLI commands:

* Continuous raw 802.11 packet transmission in the connected Station mode:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_CONNECTION_MODE=y -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_PACKET_TRANSMISSION_MODE=0

* Fixed number of raw 802.11 packet transmission in the connected Station mode:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_CONNECTION_MODE=y -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_PACKET_TRANSMISSION_MODE=1 -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_FIXED_NUM_PACKETS=<number of packets to be sent>

* Continuous raw 802.11 packet transmission in the non-connected Station mode:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_IDLE_MODE=y -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_PACKET_TRANSMISSION_MODE=0

* Fixed number of raw 802.11 packet transmission in the non-connected Station mode:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -b nrf7002dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_IDLE_MODE=y -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_PACKET_TRANSMISSION_MODE=1 -DCONFIG_RAW_TX_PACKET_SAMPLE_FIXED_NUM_PACKETS=<number of packets to be sent>

Change the build target as given below for the nRF7002 EK.

.. code-block:: console

   nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp -- -DSHIELD=nrf7002ek
